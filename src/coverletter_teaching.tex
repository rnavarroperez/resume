With over four years of physics teaching experience at the undergraduate level, a demonstrated commitment to equity in student success, as well as strong interpersonal and communication skills, I am a strong candidate for the Physics Instructor position at Mount San Jacinto College (MSJC).

I have provided physics instruction at the introductory, intermediate and advanced level to diverse student populations since spring of 2018 . My first experience teaching physics at the undergraduate level was as a postdoc at Ohio University. There, I taught an introductory level physics class to STEM majors. As an Assistant Professor at San Diego State University I have taught physics courses in different contexts, from mid size upper division classes (around 40 students) to large enrollment introductory level physics (over 300 students). I have also taught small size graduate classes (around 15 students). In addition to teaching classes, at SDSU I have also redesigned courses with the goal of creating an equitable learning environment. This redesign includes, among other changes, the adoption of an open textbook and the implementation of think-pair-share activities in class.

Although my professional career has had a strong emphasis in scientific research, as I have had more opportunities to interact with students from a broad range of backgrounds I have come to realize that I want to dedicate my time helping students achieve their professional goals by providing them with the scientific knowledge that they will need inside and outside of the classroom. I am convinced that the physics instructor position at MSJC represent an excellent opportunity to achieve that goal.

I have experience in mentoring students from underrepresented backgrounds in physics by mentoring through the NSF funded program Cal-Bridge. Cal-Bridge is a scholarship program seeking to increase participation of underrepresented groups in physics and astronomy by supporting students from primarily undergraduate California State University (CSU). As a mentor in the Cal-Bridge program I have direct knowledge of the challenges that students from disadvantaged backgrounds face when trying to achieve their academic and professional goals. As a faculty member at MSJC I could help to identify potential candidates for this program and encourage them to apply as they transfer to a 4-year program at a CSU campus.

I also have experience providing service to my current institution. At SDSU I currently serve on the College of Sciences Diversity and Inclusion committee. I collaborated with other members of this committee on the creation of the college's first Diversity, Equity and Inclusion plan. This plan was adopted by the college in the spring of 2021 and the committee is currently tasked with overseeing its implementation. Additionally, I have provided service to my department by overseeing the redesign of the undergraduate physics brochure. The goal of this new brochure is to present a degree in physics to high school students as an exciting opportunity with great job security that at the same time is accessible to students from all kinds of backgrounds.

I am convinced that my combination of teaching experience, communication skills, and commitment to diversity and excellence make me an ideal addition to the faculty at Mount San Jacinto College. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from the hiring committee.
